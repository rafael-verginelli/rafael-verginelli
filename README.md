<!-- ### Hello! I'm Rafael

Nice to meet you! I'm a Software Engineer. My journey as a developer started when I was just a kid: my father taught me how to develop applications using Visual Basic and Delphi, and soon after I was playing around developing games with RPG Maker.
After that I tried many other technologies and languages as I grew up: Unity3D and C#, Java and Eclipse, Visual Studio, C, C++, etc. Then, I ended up settling down with Android App Development in Kotlin.

## My Career and Goals
Started as an intern Game Developer, then working as an Android Developer since 2015, I realized that there are an infinite amount of things to learn and we can never stop, we need to keep studying and practicing to keep up with the recent technologies.
I am currently working as an Android dev, but my passion for coding goes beyond any specific language. I aim to become a great Fullstack Developer, to be flexible with my choices of IDE and programming languages, to excel as a tech lead, and to get a Master's degree.
When working on a project, I do my best to make sure the user experience is flawless and that the codebase is well written, clean and maintainable, to make the lives of my peers less complicated.

## Hobbies
I think coding is really fun and that more people should drop the "that's not for me" thought and try it. I truly enjoy the challenges that come with it.
On my free time I enjoy developing apps and games, and learn a bit of new technologies.
